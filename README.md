# Dijkstras-Algorithm

Dijkstra's Algorithms is the fastest way to find the shorted path between 2 vertextes in a graph.

According to graph theory, almost all problems can be converted to finding shrotest path between 2 vertexes on a graph.

Here is my Python code for the algorithm with a visual picture of the graph.
