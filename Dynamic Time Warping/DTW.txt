Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is an algorithm for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences which may
vary in speed. For instance, similarities in walking could be detected using DTW, even if one person was walking
faster than the other, or if there were accelerations and decelerations during the course of an observation. It can be
used to match a sample voice command with others command, even if the person talks faster or slower than the
prerecorded sample voice. DTW can be applied to temporal sequences of video, audio and graphics data-indeed,
any data which can be turned into a linear sequence can be analyzed with DTW.

    Spoken Word Recognition
