Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to find the shortest path between 2 nodes in a graph. It is the fastest way to get the solution. According to Graph Theory, any problem can be thought of as shortest path between 2 nodes in a graph. Thus the implimentations of the algorithm are a lot.

We start by maintaining a dictionary with values of the distance between all nodes.
Then we iterate through the nodes until the current node is the final node.
Along the way we keep chekcing if the new path is shorter than the previous one and if yes then we update the shortest path between 2 nodes in the dictionary.
Finally, we print all the results.

Here is my Python code for the algorithm along with an image of the graph to help better understand the working of the algorithm.
