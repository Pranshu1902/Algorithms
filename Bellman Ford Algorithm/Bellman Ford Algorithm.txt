Bellman-Ford Algorithm is computes the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a
weighted digraph.

Even though it is slower than Dijkstra's Algorithm, it works in the cases when the weight of the
edge is negative and it also finds negative weight cycle in the graph. The problem with Dijkstra's Algorithm is, if
there's a negative cycle, you keep going through the cycle again and again creating an infinite loop.
