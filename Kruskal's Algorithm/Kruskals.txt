Kruskal's algorithm finds a minimum spanning forest of an undirected edge-weighted graph.
Minimum spanning tree gives the edges to be chosen to connect all the nodes with least and cost and without creating a cycle.

First we sort the graph based on the weights and then iterate through it. If adding the new node creates a cycle then we ignore it else we add it.
