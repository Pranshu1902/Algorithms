Floyd-Warshall's algorithm is for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights.
A single execution of the algorithm will find the lengths (summed weights) of the shortest paths between all pair of
vertices. With a little variation, it can print the shortest path and can detect negative cycles in a graph. FloydWarshall is a Dynamic-Programming algorithm.
